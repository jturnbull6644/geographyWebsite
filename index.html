            <p>Ashgabat is the capital city of Turkmenistan. In 1924, Turkmenistan officially became a part of the Soviet Union. Ashgabat is located in a picturesque valley at the foothills of Kopet Dagh. It emerged in 1881 first as military fortress not far from a village bearing the same name. In 1885 a railway was built that reached the area. As a result, it turned into a small town.</p>
 
<p>In 1948 the city was completely destroyed by a powerful earthquake. The restoration of the capital of Turkmenistan was accomplished due to the efforts of the Soviet Union. During the 1970s, the countries energy resources were also developed by the Soviet government, including oil and natural gas. There is a university, colleges, research institutions, theatres, museums, and clubs in the city.</p>

<p>In the late 1980s, many Soviet republics attempted to gain their independence from Moscow. In 1990, the Turkmen SSR declared that it would take greater control over local politics and economic policy. The government established the office of president and named Saparmurat Niyazov to the post. On October 27, 1991 Turkmenistan proclaimed its independence from the USSR.</p>
