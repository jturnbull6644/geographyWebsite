            <p>General secondary education is compulsory and consists of ten years of study. Secondary school education is free throughout the country. Secondary school students study according to a national curriculum in the Turkmen or Russian language, but many take English as a second language. The quality of education students receive is considered poor at best because most teachers are unmotivated, and many students to not take education serious.</p>
