            <p>Ashgabat is not only a largest city and the capital of Turkmenistan, but also is cultural, financial and transportation hub. Modern buildings mingle with historic properties, imposing government buildings and the country's largest libraries and museums. There are many elegant hotels throughout the city. All the hotels, as most of the public buildings, are covered with a beautiful white marble giving the city a futuristic look.</p>
 
<p>Ashgabat has dozens of high-class hotels, including fashionable "President Hotel" opened a year ago. The well proportioned silhouette of the 17-storeyed magnificent building sparkling with stained-glass windows and glaringly white marble has become inseparable part of the urban landscape of Ashgabat's new business center rapidly growing in the Kopetdag foothills. For the short time, the hotel managed to win the title of the best one in Turkmenistan.</p>

<p>The Nissa Hotel was built in 1996. It is located in the city centre and near Independent Monument, the Residence of the President of Turkmenistan, Congress and Arts Palace. It is considered one of the finest in the country.</p>
